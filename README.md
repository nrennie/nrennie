### Hello 👋

I'm Nicola Rennie, a data visualisation specialist with a background in statistics and data science. I'm interested in understanding how to effectively communicate complex quantitative ideas in an accessible way, as well as how we do so using open source tools. I'm a committee member and secretary of the [Royal Statistical Society (RSS) Teaching Statistics Section Group](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/teaching-statistics/), and am also one of the [RSS's 2024-2025 William Guy Lecturers](https://rss.org.uk/policy-campaigns/policy-groups/education-policy-advisory-group/rss-william-guy-lecturers/william-guy-lecturers-2024-25/) who has recorded and delivered talks aimed at 11-16 year olds on the topic of using data and statistics to shape decision making in medicine and healthcare.

I co-authored the Royal Statistical Society's [Best Practices for Data Visualisation](https://rss.org.uk/datavisguide/) guidance and am a member of the Editorial Board of [Significance](https://significancemagazine.com/about/) magazine, where I'm particularly focused on data visualisation. I've also previously held roles in the [RoSE (Researchers of Statistics Education) Network](https://www.rose-network.org/about-us/meet-the-team/sig_leads), co-leading the Statistics Software Special Interest Group, and as part of the Communications team. I can often be found at data science meetups, presenting at conferences, and am the [R-Ladies Lancaster](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-lancaster/) chapter organiser as well as a committee member of the [R-Ladies Global Team](https://rladies.org/about-us/global-team/).
