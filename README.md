### Hello 👋

I'm Nicola Rennie, an academic and data scientist. I'm currently a Lecturer in Health Data Science based within the [Centre for Health Informatics, Computing, and Statistics](https://chicas.lancaster-university.uk/) at Lancaster Medical School. My research interests lie in understanding how to effectively communicate complex quantitative ideas in an accessible way e.g. to clinicians, patients, the public, and students. I also have experience in data science consultancy, and collaborate closely with external research partners. I can often be found at data science meetups, presenting at conferences, and am the [R-Ladies Lancaster](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-lancaster/) chapter organiser.

Most of the projects you'll see here use either R, Python, Rust, or Julia, with some JavaScript and CSS (among other things) sprinkled throughout.

I'm co-author of the Royal Statistical Society's [Best Practices for Data Visualisation](https://rss.org.uk/datavisguide/) guidance. I'm also one of the [Royal Statistical Society's 2024-2025 William Guy Lecturers](https://rss.org.uk/policy-campaigns/policy-groups/education-policy-advisory-group/rss-william-guy-lecturers/william-guy-lecturers-2024-25/), and will be recording and delivering a talk aimed at 11-16 year olds on the topic of using data and statistics to shape decision making in medicine and healthcare.
